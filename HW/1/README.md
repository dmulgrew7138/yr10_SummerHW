##Data Representation

###1 - Why do we represent data using binary when using computers *(1 mark)*
Because computers read 1s and zeros or on and offs.
###2 - How would we represent the number 147 in binary? *(1 mark)*
10010011
###3 - Can you convert the hexadecimal number **b5** to denary, there is a mark for you working. *(2 marks)*
181
###4 - Here is a function written is **pseudocode**.
```
FUNCTION validUser (users , user)
    FOR x <-1 to LEN(users)
        IF users[x] = user
			RETURN True
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
	RETURN False
ENDFUNCTION
```

```
integer
(b) What type of data is returned by this function? **(1 mark)**
```
integer

##Errors
###6 - This program is supposed to find the mean of a list of numbers and print it out for the user:
```
line1:		tot <- 0
line2:		nums <- [1,6,4,2,5,3]
line3:		FOR x <- to LEN(nums)
line4:			tot <- nums[x]
line5:		ENDFOR
line6:		mean <- tot
line7:		OUTPT mean
```

line7

(b) What is meant by a **syntax** error? **(1 mark)**
